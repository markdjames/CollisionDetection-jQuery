jQueryCollisionDetection
========================

__Collision Detection plugin for jQuery__

A simple, light-weight jQuery plugin to enable collision detection between HTML elements.

Features include:

 - Feedback functions let you add your own functionality each step of the way
 - Smoothing: You decide how often you want the detection to occur - useful for more demanding applications
 - Minified version is less than 1kb
 - Requires jQuery UI

This is essentially an addition to the jQuery UI Dragging functionality. See the example to see how simple it is!

How to Use
-------------------------

All you need to do is make sure you have included jQuery and jQuery UI in to your page then include collision.jquery.js afterwards.
Now all you need to do to make a collision detection pairing is initialize the function as shown in the example.
